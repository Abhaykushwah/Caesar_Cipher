# Caesar_Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a classic example of ancient cryptography and is said to have been used by Julius Caesar. The Caesar cipher is based on transposition and involves shifting each letter of the <u>plaintext message</u> by a certain number of letters, historically three, as shown in Figure 5.1. The <u>ciphertext</u> can be decrypted by applying the same number of shifts in the opposite direction. This type of encryption is known as a <u>substitution cipher</u>, due to the substitution of one letter for another in a consistent fashion.
